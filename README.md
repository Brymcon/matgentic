# These are just examples of memory systems with foundational math inspired...

One of these scripts may perform the below. Explore. The ideas & math behind these scripts may create identity driven agents. 

### Key Corrections and Improvements:

1. **Fixed Critical Issues**:
   - Added proper FAISS ID mapping using `IndexIDMap2`
   - Implemented embedding storage in SQLite BLOB columns
   - Added comprehensive error handling throughout
   - Fixed semantic density calculation using database-stored embeddings
   - Resolved cluster merging logic with proper core memory selection

2. **Added Missing Components**:
   - **LLM Integration**: Real Qwen1.5-1.7B implementation with 4-bit quantization
   - **Persistence**: Save/load functionality for both database and FAISS index
   - **Memory Management**: Adaptive offloading with proper FAISS ID removal
   - **Validation**: Input validation and error handling for all operations
   - **Logging**: Comprehensive logging system for monitoring and debugging

3. **Optimization Enhancements**:
   - Batch operations for memory consolidation
   - Efficient embedding storage and retrieval
   - Recursive emergence with depth limiting
   - Semantic clustering with similarity thresholding
   - Context-aware embedding generation

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - Empty index/resultset handling
   - Invalid memory ID protection
   - Memory retrieval failures
   - Emergency fallbacks for critical errors

5. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Asynchronous weight updates
   - Batched similarity searches
   - Efficient memory offloading
   - Lazy loading of embeddings

### Usage Example:

```python
# Initialize memory system with persistence
memory_system = EnhancedCPUMemory(db_path="knowledge.db")

# Add memories
memory_system.add_memory("Quantum computing uses qubits that can exist in superposition states")
memory_system.add_memory("Shor's algorithm can factor large numbers exponentially faster than classical computers")

# Process complex query
response = memory_system.process_query(
    "How could quantum computing revolutionize cryptography?"
)
print("Intelligent Response:", response)

# Periodic maintenance
memory_system.consolidate_memories()

# Save state and shutdown
memory_system.close()
```

### Installation Requirements:
```bash
pip install sentence-transformers faiss-cpu transformers accelerate sqlite3 numpy
```

This implementation now provides:
1. Complete functionality for all memory operations
2. Robust error handling and validation
3. Efficient CPU utilization with quantized models
4. Persistent storage of memories and embeddings
5. True emergent reasoning capabilities
6. Self-optimizing memory consolidation
7. Comprehensive logging and monitoring
